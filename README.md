# ElGamel-Cryptosystem

I used this project to apply the theory I was reading about. Going through the textbook "Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography", I found it valuable to apply the ideas with actual coding projects. So here is a rudementary implementation of the Elgamel cryptosystem. In addition to the file that has hardcoded parameters, I created alice and bob files, which are a server and client that communicate over a socket with the elgamel cryptosystem.

In the future, I plan to add a version of this using the eliptic curve elgamel cryptosystem.
